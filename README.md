learning the thing
I am trying to understand this git thing: interested in using it as an art project; a copy of a copy of a copy;
I wonder if the _things that I learn_ about **markdown** would work on this?
Great, so the ##works too?, nope, I forgot how to do header... 
anyway, good here


This is at night now,
I have done a bit more, now installed github desktop
I have clone the file from the website;
writing on readme
###still### not know how to use header
